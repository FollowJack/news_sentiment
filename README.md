# news_sentiment
This repository is part of the Open Tech School Data Science co-learning meetup 
- Here we analyze and visualize news and their sentiment -

# Purpose
News channels/papers can have a large impact on how people perceive their environment, country as well as political situation within said country. 
We thrive to analyze news and the following topics could be analyzed for example:

1. Are certain news channels more negative compared to others (do they use words frequently that resemble hate-speech, racism, etc.)?
1. Are news channels biased to report on certain topics more often than others?
1. Are there specific authors that have a bias towards negative output?
1. Which words are most frequently used in each paper / topic / 
1. Did the topics or sentiment change over time? 
1. What is the most positive news outlet in a given country?
1. Can we predict which news outlet produced an article by analyzing the word-choices/content?
1. Is this analysis country-specific? 

and many more. 

Happy coding.
